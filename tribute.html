        <h2 class="title" id="history">The History of Kirby</h2>
        <p id="tribute-info">Masahiro Sakurai conceptualized his first game project to be simple so that beginner players could easily clear it, and as a result included the ability to use enemies as weapons, as well as avoid obstacles by flying over them. Originally, the player character would grab enemies with a long tongue, but this was changed to be inhaling and then swallowing or spitting them out instead. During the early development of what became <i>Kirby's Dream Land</i>, the developers at HAL Laboratory created a placeholder sprite intended to convey these ideas for a presentation. This placeholder sprite, a round little blob with a smiling face, became popular among the staff and, with a few tweaks, eventually became the final design.</p>
